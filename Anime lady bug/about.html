             <p>Jokes aside, as a person who only leaves their house about twice a month to shop, let me tell you that the first week of staying home is super fun and flush with stuff to do – but its every week after that where it gets a little dicey. If you are bored – so truly, unimaginably bored – now is the time to check a few things off your anime list. If you, for whatever reason, don’t know where to start – we got anime recommendations</p>
